## Miceink - Creates paper like experience

Miceink is used to create paper-like drawing experience on touchpads and mouses!<br>
Vist <a href="#vid_demos">demos</a> to see how it works!

### But... What is it?
With miceink you CAN draw on your touchpad WITHOUT any click!<br>
Seems awsome, right?

Create quick-notes, think and solve math problems with ease on your computer!<br>
There is now no need of tablet!

**Hmmm but wait, there is an Inklet wich does it**<br>
No.<br>
With inklet you NEED click, in miceink you do not need ANY click (but you can, if you want)

### But... Why?

So, huh... Imagine how would it be awsome when you have a laptop<br>
and you need to quicknote note something but instead you need to<br> 
make click-click-click-click-click, it makes very nervous, right?<br>
Miceink makes it easy to draw everything without clicks

### But... How it works?

Miceink detects speed of your mouse movement and then miceink can determine to turn on/off the pen.<br>
Thats no more philospohy!

### So how to run?

Running is very easy!<br>
Only what you need is to download a binary from Releases tab on our github repository, run it, and there you are!

### Ok, but does are some tutorials on that?

It is very simple.<br>
After you ran app, click to enable the system (program needs to know when you started drawing). If you drawing something it automatically turns on/off your pen.

### Tips & Tricks

**Right click** `->` Toogles the drawing system
**Left click** `->` Toogles the system wich runs moves selection algorithm (Disabled for now)
