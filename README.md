## Miceink - Creates paper like experience

Miceink is app created to create paper-like drawing experience on touchpads and mouses!<br>
Vist <a href="#vid_demos">demos</a> to see how it works!

### What is it?
With Miceink you can draw on your touchpad with ease<br>
Seems awsome, right?

Create quick-notes, think and solve math problems with ease on your computer!<br>
There is now no need of using tablet!

### What about Inklet?
With inklet you need to click every time if you want to turn off the pen<br>
in miceink you do not need any switching, just draw like on paper (but you can, if you want)

### Why Miceink?

So, huh... Imagine how would it be awsome when you have a laptop<br>
and you need to quicknote note something but instead you need to<br> 
make click-click-click-click-click, it makes very nervous, right?<br>
Miceink makes it easy to draw everything without clicks

### How it works?

Miceink detects speed of your mouse movement and then miceink can determine to turn on/off the pen.<br>
Thats no more philospohy!

### How to run?

It can be done in 4 steps

1. Launch terminal
2. Install GUI library `pip3 install pygame`
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Mondonno/miceink.git`
4. Type `cd src`
5. Then run it via python `python3 main.py`

### Tutorials

It is very simple.<br>
After you ran app, click to enable the system (program needs to know when you started drawing).
If you drawing something it automatically turns on/off your pen.

### Tips & Tricks

**Right click** `->` Toogles the drawing system<br>
**Left click** `->` Toogles the system wich runs moves selection algorithm (Disabled for now)
**"S" key** `->` Saves your current work into `miceink.png` in working directory.
