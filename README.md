# Miceink - Creates paper like experience

Miceink is used to create paper-like drawing experience on touchpads and mouses!
Vist <a href="#vid_demos">demos</a> to see how it works!

## But... What is it?
With miceink you CAN draw on your touchpad WITHOUT any click!
Seems awsome, right?

Create quick-notes, think and solve math problems with ease on your computer! There is now no need of tablet!

**Hmmm but wait, there is an Inklet wich does it**
No. With inklet you NEED click, in miceink you do not need ANY click (but you can, if you want)

## But... Why?

So, huh... Imagine how would it be awsome when you have a laptop and you need to quicknote note something but instead you need to make click-click-click-click-click, it makes very nervous, right? Miceink makes it easy to draw everything without CLICKS!!!!!

## But... How it works?

Miceink detects speed of your mouse movement and then miceink can determine to turn on/off the pen. Thats no more philospohy!

## So how to run?

Running is very easy!
Only what you need is to download a binary from Releases tab on our github repository, run it, and there you are!

## Ok, but does are some tutorials on that?

It is very simple.
After you ran app, click to enable the system (program needs to know when you started drawing). If you drawing something it automatically turns on/off your pen.

## Tips & Tricks

**Right click** `->` Toogles the drawing system
**Left click** `->` Toogles the system wich runs moves selection algorithm (Disabled for now)
